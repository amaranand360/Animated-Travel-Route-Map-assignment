# Travel Route Visualization App

## Project Overview

This Flutter app allows users to visualize their travel routes by entering multiple locations and selecting modes of transport between them. The app displays the travel route on a map with markers for each location and uses transport mode icons to represent each segment of the journey. The route is animated from the starting point to the final destination, highlighting each segment of the journey.

**Key Features:**
- Users can enter multiple locations (e.g., Delhi, Mumbai, Pune) and select transport modes (e.g., plane, car, train) for each segment of the journey.
- The app displays the travel route on a map with markers for each location.
- Each segment of the journey is represented by icons for the selected transport mode.
- The app animates the route from the start to the end, highlighting each segment of the journey.
- **Google Maps Directions API** is used to calculate the route and provide directions.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A framework for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- **Google Maps SDK for Flutter**: For displaying the map and route visualization.
- **Google Maps Directions API**: To fetch directions between locations and generate the route.
